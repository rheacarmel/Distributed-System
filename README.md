# Distributed-System
1) Simple Messenger on Anroid : Developed a simple messenger app on Android where two Android devices can send messages to each other. The purpose of this assignment was to understand Socket Programming and Android functionalities. https://github.com/rheacarmel/Distributed-System/tree/master/SimpleMessenger/app/src/main/java/edu/buffalo/cse/cse486586/simplemessenger

2) Group Messenger with Local Persistent Key-Value Table:
   Developed a group messenger that sends messages to mutiple AVDs and store them in a permanent key-value storage. The purpose of this assignment was to understand Content Provider  and Multicast Implementation.

3) Group Messenger with Total and FIFO Ordering Guarantees: 
   This project guarantees order to the group message using total orderings as well as FIFO ordering. Designed and Implemented the Total and FIFO ordering algorithms which guarantees order in messages even with an app failure during execution.

5) Simple Dynamo: 
   Implemented simplified version of Dynamo. Implemented Partitioning, Replication and Failure Handling with a goal to provide availabaility and linearizability at the same time.
 For linearizability Quorum replication was implemented.
